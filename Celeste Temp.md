Background:

I live in the Brass Lane. Located kinda central, kinda middle class. Live above a stationary store that sells books and trinkets and doo-dads. "Write This Way"

Why Am I Here?

The Empire has never been more divided.  I'm here to ensure politicians stay grounded with real life.  And to help ensure the common folk understand that the government is made of people, too.
