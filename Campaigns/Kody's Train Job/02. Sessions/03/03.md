	- meet outside Celestian Station

# main

- everyone gets ready
	- Grael pays some money and disappears
- we head down toward the station
	- it smells like sea breeze and some kind of exhaust from the aether carriages
- grael helps take our bags, as someone that works for the train
- kaelan motions to us and we follow him into a demi-plane
	- gave us fake identities and tickets
	- celeste calms him, fixes his watch, then breaks a vase taking a paper with a cipher on it
	- karla takes flowers
- grael almost gets caught pretending to be a train employee
	- so he breaks a steam pipe and causes a big distraction
	- everyone is distracted, and he sneaks away
- doc tries to get cocky with the ticket taker in the first class line
	- name tag "Inspector Valen"
	- he bribes his way on with 50gp
	- tickets have some special marking after being authorized
- we meet Helen Kummlicher (cum-licker)
	- she's older and rich and has banged a lot of famous dudes
	- Doc is unimpressive, and his presence makes Helen call for her body guard
		- Kitty Penisfac√© (penne-fach-ey), she/her
	- her valet comes along, named Bussnell Muffdiver (of Bussy for short)
- whistle announces arrival of aether carriage
	- it arrives, floating, but with some kinda magic street car electricity things connecting from underneath as it passes over them
	- 10 cars, has second floor with small spiral stairs connecting floors
	- more room inside than you'd expect
	- all cars connected (except the engine car)
	- first car - first class
	- second car - dining
	- 
- guy in first class kinda stands out, his face keeps popping up here and there. non-descript and common, but perhaps some draconic attributes
	- too far away to determine if it's a disguise
- doc locks his room door, and gets nekkid and "writhes" on his bed
-
