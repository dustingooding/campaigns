  description: "An artifact of concealment, granting its wearer the ability to slip into invisibility, to walk unseen through places where light would betray others. But as you gaze upon it, you sense it holds a price — a pull that draws shadows closer to the soul of whoever wears it.\n\nA delicate but strangely ominous amulet, suspended from a chain of tarnished silver. The amulet itself is crafted from a polished obsidian stone, so dark it almost seems to drink in the light around it. Carved into its surface is a swirling, intricate pattern — almost like tendrils of shadow captured in glass. Tiny, glimmering fragments of silver dust are embedded within the stone, sparking faintly like stars in a night sky.\n\nAs you get closer, you feel a subtle chill emanating from the amulet, and the air around it seems to ripple slightly, as if reality itself is bending to hide it from view. It’s as if the amulet is alive, shifting in and out of focus, making it hard to look at for too long. You get the distinct impression that this is no ordinary trinket. This amulet feels… hungry, like it’s waiting for someone to claim its power."
