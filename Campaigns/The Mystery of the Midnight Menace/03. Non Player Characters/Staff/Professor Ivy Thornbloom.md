  description: "**Description**: Professor Thornbloom is a short, sprightly woman with wild, curly red hair speckled with gray. She’s known for her unpredictable teaching style and a personality as fiery as the potions she brews. Thornbloom has an encyclopedic knowledge of magical plants and alchemical ingredients, though her eccentric demeanor sometimes makes students feel like she’s off in her own world.\n\n**Useful Information**: She’s familiar with potions that use \"shadow essence\" and can provide ingredients or insights on rituals that involve cloaking or concealment. Students know that Thornbloom has an extensive supply cabinet, though she’s protective of her rarer materials.\n\n**Player Interaction**: Players might persuade her to share alchemical knowledge, ingredients, or even a temporary \"shadow sight\" potion that reveals hidden objects or pathways. She might also subtly hint that she knows Mr. Moss has used her supplies for mysterious purposes in the past."
