  description: "**Description**: Eloise is a stern, meticulous woman in her 50s who takes her role seriously. With her sharp eyes and even sharper tongue, she keeps a tight rein on the school’s order. Though intimidating, she is not unkind, and she has a genuine concern for students’ welfare beneath her strict exterior.\n\n**Useful Information**: Eloise has access to all student and faculty records, as well as keys to many of the school’s restricted areas. Her sharp memory and attention to detail mean she notices small changes around the school — like recent disturbances in the basement storeroom.\n\n**Player Interaction**: If players present a compelling argument, Eloise might grant access to restricted rooms or share suspicious staff records. She might also mention Mr. Moss’s recent request for more supplies than usual, or hint that she’s noticed his late-night movements around campus."
