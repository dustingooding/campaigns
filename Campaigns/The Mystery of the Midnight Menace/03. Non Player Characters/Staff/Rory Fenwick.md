  description: "**Description**: Rory is a gangly, soft-spoken young man in his late teens with round glasses and an insatiable curiosity. He’s not a student himself but spends most of his time in the library, cataloging books and transcribing texts. He has a knack for finding rare manuscripts and obscure texts, and his quiet presence makes him almost blend into the background.\n\n**Useful Information**: Rory knows every nook and cranny of the library and has access to restricted sections that may hold information on ancient artifacts like the Amulet of Shadows. He’s also seen suspicious people passing through, though he’s often too shy to confront them.\n\n**Player Interaction**: Rory can help players access hidden tomes on shadow magic, history, or school lore. If players earn his trust, he might share secret passages he’s discovered or pass along rumors about Mr. Moss’s late-night visits to the archives."
