  description: "Mr. Jonathan Moss is a wiry, unassuming man in his early 60s with a perpetually rumpled appearance and an air of quiet contentment. His face is weathered, marked by deep lines that suggest years of laughter, but his eyes — a sharp, steely gray — hint at a hidden depth that students often overlook. He wears a simple, faded gray jacket and patched trousers, the cuffs of his sleeves perpetually dusted with chalk and grime from countless hours of work around the school. A sturdy leather tool belt hangs around his waist, stocked with various tools, from a well-worn wrench to a bundle of rusty keys, each of which jingles softly as he walks.\n\nDespite his mild demeanor, there’s a certain grace to his movements, a careful precision as he goes about his work, never hurried but never idle. His hands are calloused but steady, and students occasionally notice that he seems to know the old school building better than anyone else — often appearing just when he’s needed, quietly fixing things in the background.\n\nThere’s a faint smell of earth and wood polish about him, as if he carries with him the essence of the school’s hidden, forgotten spaces. Though most students see him as simply the friendly janitor with a soft smile and easy laugh, those who look closer may notice a fleeting glint of something more in his eyes — a watchfulness, perhaps, or a guarded knowledge of the school’s more mysterious corners."
