  description: "**Description**: Nina is an upperclassman with a quiet but intense presence, known for her obsession with the school’s history and the rumors surrounding it. She’s usually found in the archives, poring over documents, and has extensive knowledge of the academy’s past mysteries and magical artifacts.\n\n**Useful Information**: Nina knows a great deal about the Amulet of Shadows and its past uses, as well as legends about past students who may have harnessed its power. Her fascination with magical relics means she’s already pieced together some of the puzzle and might share her theories if the players gain her trust.\n\n**Player Interaction**: Players can ask Nina for clues about the amulet’s powers or consult her about the strange markings found in the secret room. She might even have an old map showing hidden rooms in the basement."
