  description: "**Description**: Cass is a bright-eyed, perpetually grinning student with messy brown hair and a knack for getting into trouble. Known for his talent with illusion spells, Cass is rarely without a clever trick up his sleeve, and he’s always willing to share a laugh — or a prank.\n\n**Useful Information**: Cass has explored many of the school’s secret rooms and might be one of the few students who’s noticed Mr. Moss's strange comings and goings. He’s also heard rumors of “shadow magic” being practiced somewhere on campus and is keen to figure out where it’s happening.\n\n**Player Interaction**: Cass can be persuaded to share his knowledge of the school’s hidden areas, especially if players prove they’re in on the adventure. He might also offer to help them create distractions, illusions, or fake passes to restricted areas. Just make sure he doesn’t turn the mystery into another one of his pranks."
