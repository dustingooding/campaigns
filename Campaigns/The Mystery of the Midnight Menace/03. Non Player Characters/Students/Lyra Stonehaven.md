  description: "**Description**: Lyra is a soft-spoken student with long, dark braids and a calm, steady gaze. Though she tends to keep to herself, she’s deeply empathetic and always willing to lend a hand, especially in matters of healing or herbology. Many students seek her out for potions or cures.\n\n**Useful Information**: Lyra has a part-time role assisting Professor Thornbloom in the alchemy lab and is often trusted with gathering rare ingredients. She’s seen the school’s storerooms and knows of Mr. Moss’s peculiar late-night supply runs. She might also recognize the smell or signs of “shadow essence” if she comes across it.\n\n**Player Interaction**: Lyra could help players by brewing minor potions for focus or perception or even lending some healing salves if needed. If players share their suspicions with her, she might subtly assist by giving hints about what she’s observed — but she’ll be wary, as she’s afraid of breaking any rules."
