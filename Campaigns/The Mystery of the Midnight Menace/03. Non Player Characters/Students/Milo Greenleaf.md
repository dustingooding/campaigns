  description: "**Description**: Milo is a lanky, overexcitable student with short, curly hair and an ever-present notebook filled with wild theories about the school. He’s highly animated, often talking a mile a minute about everything from the “underground tunnels” to “enchanted relics” he believes the school is hiding. Though his ideas often sound absurd, Milo sometimes gets startlingly close to the truth.\n\n**Useful Information**: Milo has a surprisingly deep knowledge of school lore, legends, and past mysteries — including whispered tales about the Amulet of Shadows. He’s convinced something big is happening in the basement storerooms and often lurks around trying to spot clues. However, his tendency to exaggerate means he’s often dismissed by others.\n\n**Player Interaction**: If players take Milo seriously and hear him out, he may provide important clues disguised as conspiracy theories. He might even share his notebook, which contains a hand-drawn map of secret places or details about Mr. Moss that Milo has obsessively tracked. However, players will have to separate fact from fiction in his information."
