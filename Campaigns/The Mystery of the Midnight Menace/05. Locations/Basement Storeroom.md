  description: "The basement storeroom is colder than the rest of the school, the stone walls damp with condensation. Dim light spills from a single, flickering bulb, casting long shadows across the rows of shelves lined with crates, dusty old textbooks, and forgotten pieces of school equipment. The air is thick and musty, with the scent of mildew and old paper hanging heavy."
