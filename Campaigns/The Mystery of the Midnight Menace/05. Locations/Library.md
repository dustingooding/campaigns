  description: "The room stretches up and outward, shelves packed with books lining every inch of wall, seeming to grow taller the further you look. Floating candles drift overhead, casting a warm, flickering glow across the shelves and casting intricate shadows that make the room feel alive.\n\nThe towering shelves are lined with tomes bound in faded leather, their spines etched with gold letters that shimmer as the candlelight catches them. The soft rustle of pages echoes faintly from one of the alcoves, as if the library itself is breathing."
