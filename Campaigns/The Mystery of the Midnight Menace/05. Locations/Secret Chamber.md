  description: "This hidden chamber is circular and lined with worn stone arches that speak of an ancient, forgotten purpose.\n\nIn the center of the room, on a stone pedestal, rests the [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/10. Objects/Amulet of Shadows.md|Amulet of Shadows]] . It’s smaller than you imagined — a dark, gleaming pendant, suspended from a tarnished silver chain. The amulet seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy, as if breathing in time with the shadows around it. The air here feels thick with magic, and a faint hum fills your ears as you approach."
