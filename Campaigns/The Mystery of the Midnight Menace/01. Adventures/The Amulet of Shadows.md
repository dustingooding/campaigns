  description: "The game takes place at Evercreek Academy, a sprawling, slightly eerie school of both mundane and magical studies. The academy has a long-standing reputation for being a place where students not only learn about history, languages, mathematics, and magic but also grow into powerful adventurers. Recently, students have reported strange incidents happening in the middle of the night: books vanishing from the library, cauldrons bubbling on their own in the alchemy labs, and mysterious notes left in the dorm rooms.\n\nThe players are first-year students who discover a troubling mystery. Rumors are swirling that an “entity” has been spotted lurking around the school grounds at midnight, and certain items seem to go missing every night. The headmaster and faculty dismiss these events as pranks, but the players overhear whispers of a powerful artifact rumored to be hidden somewhere in the school. Could it be related?\n\nThe players must uncover who or what is behind the strange occurrences at Evercreek Academy and discover the true motivation behind these nightly disruptions. Their investigation will lead them to surprising discoveries about the staff and a powerful item hidden on school grounds."

    ki: "The students (our player characters) are first-year students at Evercreek Academy, a prestigious school blending mundane studies with magical arts. The school is abuzz with rumors about strange happenings at night: shadows darting through the halls, items vanishing mysteriously, and whispers of an ancient artifact hidden somewhere on the grounds.\n\nAt dinner in the Dining Hall, the players overhear rumors about a figure students have nicknamed the “Midnight Menace” and the “Amulet of Shadows,” a mystical item that grants its user invisibility. Curious and eager to prove themselves, the players decide to investigate. They have leads about key locations where strange events have been reported: the Library, Alchemy Lab, Janitor’s Closet, and Basement Storeroom."
    sho: "The players dive into their investigation, visiting each location and collecting clues. They discover various hints that point to an unusual disturbance pattern and possibly someone trying to access the rumored amulet. Each location reveals a bit more of the mystery:\n\n- Library: Scratches on the floor near shelves, torn pages from books on ancient artifacts.\n- Alchemy Lab: A cauldron bubbling with an Obscuring Mist potion and a list of ingredients for crafting an invisibility spell.\n- Janitor’s Closet: A hidden note tucked in a drawer with a schedule of “incidents” and a rough sketch of the amulet.\n- Basement Storeroom: Boxes recently moved, exposing a trapdoor leading further down.\n\nIn each place, the players run into Mr. Moss, the janitor, who’s always friendly and helpful. He often appears just after they start snooping around, giving plausible explanations about why he’s there — yet there’s something odd about his repeated appearances.\n\nAs they gather clues, the players begin to suspect that someone, perhaps Mr. Moss himself, might be connected to the strange occurrences. They’re drawn deeper into the mystery, piecing together information that reveals the layout of the trapdoor in the basement that could lead to the fabled amulet."
    ten: "Following the clues, the players locate and open the trapdoor in the Basement Storeroom, revealing a hidden chamber below the school. Inside, they find the Amulet of Shadows resting on a stone pedestal, faintly glowing in the dark.\n\nJust as they approach the amulet, Mr. Moss appears, stepping out from the shadows. However, instead of a grand confrontation, he surprises them by explaining his motivations. Years ago, he stumbled upon the amulet and has been using it to quietly test students’ bravery and intellect. Mr. Moss believes that every generation of students should be prepared for challenges and that small, orchestrated mysteries help cultivate that strength.\n\nHowever, he admits that he’s grown attached to the amulet’s power and has struggled with the idea of returning it to the school. He insists he’s only used it for “good,” by giving the students a challenge that would one day serve them well. But as the players listen, they sense the faintest hint of regret in his words, as if he may be realizing the risks of wielding such a powerful object himself."
    ketsu: "Mr. Moss, after some thought, reluctantly offers to let the players decide the amulet’s fate. They can choose to leave it in his care, knowing his benign intentions, or bring it back to the headmaster as a final act of closure to the mystery. Whatever they decide, Mr. Moss smiles knowingly, respecting their decision as they’ve passed his test and shown courage in unraveling the mystery of the Midnight Menace.\n\nWhen the players return to their familiar routines, they find that word of their investigation has spread. The headmaster and faculty subtly acknowledge their bravery, granting them small privileges like special tokens or invitations to advanced courses.\n\nThrough this experience, the players leave the adventure with a heightened sense of curiosity, knowledge, and camaraderie. Their time unraveling the Midnight Menace has prepared them, in ways they couldn’t yet know, for greater mysteries that await them at Evercreek Academy."
