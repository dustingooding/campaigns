  description: "Sho.\n\nThe [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/05. Locations/Basement Storeroom.md|Basement Storeroom]] is colder than the rest of the school, the stone walls damp with condensation. Dim light spills from a single, flickering bulb, casting long shadows across the rows of shelves lined with crates, dusty old textbooks, and forgotten pieces of school equipment. The air is thick and musty, with the scent of mildew and old paper hanging heavy.\n\nThe quiet is almost oppressive, and every sound you make seems to echo back at you from the stone walls. As your eyes adjust, you notice that one section of the wall, at the far end of the room, seems a little… off. There’s a faint line in the stone, almost like the outline of a doorway.\n\nWhat would you like to investigate first?\n\n**If players choose to check the shelves for anything unusual:**\n\nYou run your hands over the shelves, dust rising in small clouds as you sift through the piles of old books and storage crates. At first, it all seems ordinary — until you come across a crate with broken glass inside and a small, empty vial labeled “Essence of Shadow.” It looks like it was used recently, judging by the slight glimmer left on the inside of the vial.\n\n> Prompt players to make an Investigation check to search more thoroughly, or an Arcana check if they’re familiar with alchemical components.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Secret Note in Basement.md|Secret Note in Basement]] \n\n**If players examine the strange outline on the wall:**\n\nAs you approach the far wall, the faint outline of a doorway becomes more visible. There are no visible hinges or handles, but you can make out a pattern on one of the stones, almost like a handprint.\n\n> Encourage players to make an Investigation or Perception check to examine the door, or suggest that someone touch the handprint if they’re curious.\n\nIf a player presses the handprint: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Secret Door in Basement.md|Secret Door in Basement]] \n\n**If players investigate the floor or make checks to find hidden details:**\n\nThe dusty floor reveals faint scuff marks leading directly to the hidden door. Whoever came down here was careful but didn’t realize they were leaving a trail. Following the faint marks, you also spot a few drops of silvery powder near the doorway, hinting that someone recently carried an alchemical component through here.\n\n> Invite players to make Survival or Investigation checks if they want to follow the trail further or understand more about who might have been here.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Floor Marks in Basement.md|Floor Marks in Basement]] \n\n**If players detect any strange sounds or magical auras in the room:**\n\nAs you pause to listen, you catch a faint, rhythmic sound coming from beyond the hidden door, almost like chanting or the hum of an arcane ritual. The hairs on the back of your neck prick up as the air thickens with an unnatural energy.\n\n> Invite players to make an Arcana check or Perception check to sense the nature of the magic or recognize any specific words in the chanting.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/False Sounds in Basement.md|False Sounds in Basement]] \n\n**If players decide to open or investigate inside the secret door:**\n\nThe darkness inside the hidden passage is nearly absolute, and the rough stone walls are close, creating a claustrophobic tunnel leading further into the unknown. As you take a few steps forward, your footsteps echo hollowly, and you notice symbols carved into the walls — markings used for tracking or guiding. They look fresh.\n\n> Encourage players to make Survival or History checks if they’re curious about the symbols. They could also use light sources to explore the passage.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Symbols in Basement.md|Symbols in Basement]] "
