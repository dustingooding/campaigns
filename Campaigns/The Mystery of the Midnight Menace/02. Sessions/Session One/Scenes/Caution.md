  description: "Ketsu.\n\nThe morning light filters softly through the dining hall's arched windows as you and your companions find yourselves called to the front of the room. [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/03. Non Player Characters/Staff/Eloise Merriweather.md|Mrs. Merriweather]] stands before you, her sharp eyes fixed on each of you, and though her expression is composed, there's an intensity beneath her gaze.\n\nThe hall quiets, and she clears her throat, addressing the room. \n\n> “Yesterday, our school was faced with a dangerous power, something we have kept hidden and guarded for many years. It came to light... and yet, it did not fall into the wrong hands. It came into yours.” Her eyes linger on you, a flicker of something unspoken in their depths. “You showed incredible courage and ingenuity, but with that strength comes a great responsibility.”\n\nHer voice softens, just a fraction. \n\n> “This school has seen many artifacts and ancient powers, some of which should remain hidden. And while I know that there are those who would fear such power, I believe that you can bear it — wisely. Carefully. So, I extend an offer to you, on behalf of the academy.”\n\nShe pauses, letting her words sink in. \n\n> “For the remainder of the semester, you are granted admittance to the Honors Practicum, a special course designed for those who have proven themselves capable of handling... extraordinary things. In these classes, you will work alongside our finest professors, learning the control and discipline that such power demands. And you will be watched — not to curb you, but to guide you.”\n\nShe meets each of your gazes one more time, a slight nod of acknowledgment and perhaps even trust. \n\n> “Welcome to the Honors class. May you keep our school’s trust, and may your judgment honor the responsibility you now carry.”\n\nThe room fills with applause, though some students exchange uncertain glances, sensing the gravity of what just occurred. You feel the weight of Mrs. Merriweather’s words settle over you, along with the burden — and possibility — of the amulet you now possess."
