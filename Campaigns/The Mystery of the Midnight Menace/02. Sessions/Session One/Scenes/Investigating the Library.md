  description: "Sho.\n\nAs you step into the [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/05. Locations/Library.md|Library]], the doors creak faintly, and the scent of parchment and old wood fills the air. The room stretches up and outward, shelves packed with books lining every inch of wall, seeming to grow taller the further you look. Floating candles drift overhead, casting a warm, flickering glow across the shelves and casting intricate shadows that make the room feel alive.\n\nThe towering shelves are lined with tomes bound in faded leather, their spines etched with gold letters that shimmer as the candlelight catches them. The soft rustle of pages echoes faintly from one of the alcoves, as if the library itself is breathing.\n\nAt the far end of the room is a shadowed area with high-backed armchairs and tables scattered with scrolls, ink pots, and stacks of notes. A few desks hold crystal orbs and quills that hover gently, ready to write at a moment’s notice. Smaller alcoves along the walls house rare books and artifacts, displayed behind glass cases and surrounded by delicate, dusty curtains. To your right, a staircase spirals upward, leading to a dimly lit mezzanine with even more shelves and a row of alcoves filled with obscure and restricted volumes.\n\n**Noticing Strange Markings on the Shelves:** As you walk by the shelves, you notice a faint set of symbols scratched into the wood along the side of one of the aisles. They look almost like runes or code, easy to miss unless you're looking closely.\n\n> Encourage players to make Investigation or Arcana checks to decipher the symbols or sense any lingering magic.\n\nSuccessful Investigation: The runes seem to be a subtle marking system, as if someone were leaving a trail. It leads toward a darkened section of the mezzanine where more ancient, powerful tomes are stored.\n\n**Listening to the Library’s \"Sounds\":** While searching through the alcoves, you hear faint whispers echoing from somewhere nearby — though the library is nearly empty, the whispers seem to carry names, dates, or soft laughter, as if voices are trapped within the books themselves.\n\n> Invite players to make Perception checks to pinpoint where the sounds are coming from or attempt an Arcana check to discern if the sounds are magical.\n\nSuccessful Perception or Arcana: The whispers lead the players toward a hidden compartment in one of the larger bookcases. Inside, they find a sealed scroll with faint magical energy that seems connected to shadows or cloaking magic.\n\n**Finding Rory the Library Assistant:** You spot [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/03. Non Player Characters/Staff/Rory Fenwick.md|Rory Fenwick]], the library assistant, partially hidden behind a stack of books. He’s whispering to himself, scribbling notes furiously in a small journal as he searches the restricted section shelves. When he notices you, he looks startled, glancing around as if worried someone might see.\n\n> Allow players to approach and engage Rory in conversation. They might need Persuasion or Insight checks to coax information from him.\n\nInsight: Rory seems both nervous and excited. If players question him, he reluctantly shares that he’s been investigating [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/03. Non Player Characters/Staff/Professor Ivy Thornbloom.md|Professor Ivy Thornbloom]]'s recent interest in certain restricted books on shadow magic and concealment spells.\n\n**Discerning the Books’ Secrets:**\n\nWhile examining the books, you notice that a few of the older tomes have hand-scribed notes in the margins, mentioning rituals to \"bind the shadows\" and obscure individuals from sight. Some of these notes appear to be newer than others, as though someone has been updating them.\n\n> Encourage players to roll Investigation to find specific passages or History to understand the books’ contexts.\n\nSuccessful Investigation or History: They find a note wedged between two pages, written in familiar handwriting. It warns of the dangers of misuse and describes rituals meant to bind a powerful shadow creature.\n\nAs the players continue searching, the library’s vast space and eerie quiet begin to feel almost watchful. The flickering lights create the illusion that the shadows are moving, shifting ever so slightly with each step they take, as though the library itself is aware of their presence… or perhaps something else is."
