  description: "Sho.\n\nThe [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/05. Locations/Janitor's Closet.md|Janitor's Closet]] is tucked away at the end of a dimly lit corridor, hidden behind a door that’s nearly lost in the shadows of the stone wall. A faded sign reads \"Maintenance\" in chipped lettering, and the door creaks as you push it open, revealing a cramped but well-organized space filled with shelves stacked with cleaning supplies, mops, and buckets. The faint smell of disinfectant and old wood fills the air.\n\nInside, it’s tight quarters, with tools and supplies neatly arranged, yet the dim, flickering light from a single dusty bulb casts long shadows. The room seems unremarkable at first, but the quiet feels… heavy, as if something more than just cleaning supplies is hiding here.\n\n**If players examine the shelves and supplies:**\n\nAs you run your hands along the shelves, you notice an odd assortment of items, some of which seem out of place: a glass bottle labeled “Invisible Ink,” a small pouch of glittering powder, and a stack of dusty old school records bound with twine. There’s also a strange, oily residue on the shelf near the back.\n\n> Encourage players to make Investigation checks here. Success could reveal something unusual about the powder or ink.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Invisible Ink in Janitor's Closet.md|Invisible Ink in Janitor's Closet]] \n\n**If players inspect the janitor’s personal items (like the tool bag or pockets of a coat):**\n\nHanging from a peg is Mr. Moss’s old leather coat, its pockets worn and bulging slightly. Next to it, his tool bag sits on a low shelf, containing the usual assortment of wrenches and screwdrivers — but there’s also a crumpled piece of parchment poking out of the pocket.\n\n> Encourage players to check the pocket or unfold the note. They can make an Investigation or Insight check to discern more about the contents of the note.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Secret Note in Janitor's Closet.md|Secret Note in Janitor's Closet]] \n\n**If players ask about any odd smells or magical auras in the room:**\n\nThe usual scents of cleaning supplies are strong, but beneath it all, you detect a faint, earthy smell — like the damp stone of the school’s old basements. A low hum seems to resonate faintly through the walls.\n\n> Invite players to make an Arcana or Perception check to analyze the hum and smell.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07.
