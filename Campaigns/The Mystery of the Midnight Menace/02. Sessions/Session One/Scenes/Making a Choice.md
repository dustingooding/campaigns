  description: "Ten.\n\nAt this moment, a figure steps into the doorway: [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/03. Non Player Characters/Staff/Janitor Jonathan Moss.md|Janitor Moss]].\n\nHis normally friendly, soft expression is clouded with worry. He stands there silently for a moment, his gaze flicking from you to the amulet in your hands, a strange sadness settling over his features. Then, he speaks quietly, almost pleadingly.\n\n> \"I knew someone would find it eventually. I had hoped… well, perhaps it’s best that you know. This amulet was meant to be hidden. It was never supposed to be used — and certainly not by the students.\"\n\nHe steps forward, his voice low and filled with an odd mixture of regret and resolve.\n\n> \"You’re smart enough to know that some things should remain in the shadows. This amulet has the power to cloak more than just people. It can hide secrets, misdeeds… even truths.\"\n\nMr. Moss pauses, looking at you intently.\n\n**If players question Mr. Moss’s intentions:**\n\nMr. Moss sighs, the lines on his face deepening as he speaks.\n\n> \"I protected this amulet because I believed it could be a force for good — a shield to protect students like you from things the world isn’t ready to understand. But now… I fear it might only cause harm.\"\n\n> Invite players to make Insight checks to gauge his sincerity. A high roll reveals that Moss truly cares about protecting the school, but he also harbors guilt, as though he’s already used the amulet for personal reasons.\n\n**If players decide to keep the amulet:**\n\nMr. Moss tenses but nods slightly, as if he expected this.\n\n> \"If you choose to keep it, understand the responsibility that comes with it. You must decide whether to use it to protect, or to control. But remember, once the shadows answer to you, it may be difficult to step back into the light.\"\n\n> Encourage players to think about the consequences and what it means to possess something as powerful as the Amulet of Shadows. They might choose to keep it, but with a sense of caution, or even consider safeguarding it in the school’s archives.\n\nContinue to: [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/02. Sessions/Session One/Scenes/Caution.md|Caution]] \n\n**If players decide to return the amulet to Mr. Moss or secure it in the archives:**\n\nMr. Moss’s face softens with relief, and he steps forward, gently taking the amulet from your hands if you allow him.\n\n> \"Thank you. Sometimes the greatest strength is in knowing when to let something go.\"\n\nHe pockets the amulet carefully, glancing over his shoulder as if ensuring no one else has followed. Then, he looks back at you with a weary smile.\n\n> \"I’ll see to it that it’s hidden away… again. If I can keep its power out of sight, maybe, just maybe, the shadows won’t find a way back into the school.\"\n\nContinue to: [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/02.
