  description: "Ten.\n\nThe secret passage leads you deeper beneath the school, the air growing colder and more stale with each step. Flickering torch sconces line the narrow corridor, casting shadows that dance along the damp stone walls. Eventually, the passage opens up into a [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/05. Locations/Secret Chamber.md|Secret Chamber]], circular and lined with worn stone arches that speak of an ancient, forgotten purpose.\n\nIn the center of the room, on a stone pedestal, rests the [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/10. Objects/Amulet of Shadows.md|Amulet of Shadows]] . It’s smaller than you imagined — a dark, gleaming pendant, suspended from a tarnished silver chain. The amulet seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy, as if breathing in time with the shadows around it. The air here feels thick with magic, and a faint hum fills your ears as you approach.\n\n**If players examine the amulet without touching it:**\n\nAs you draw closer, you notice the amulet’s surface shifting, revealing etched runes that seem to twist and reshape in the flickering light. These are powerful wards — perhaps designed to guard against anyone unworthy from wielding it. The amulet almost feels… alive, watching and waiting.\n\n> Invite players to make an Arcana or History check to understand the magic or the significance of the runes.\n\nOn a successful check: [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Amulet Runes.md|Amulet Runes]] \n\n**If players attempt to touch or pick up the amulet:**\n\nThe moment your fingers graze the cool metal, an intense chill shoots through you, and the shadows in the room deepen momentarily. It feels as though the amulet is sapping some of your warmth, testing your intentions.\n\n> Encourage players to make a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw, representing their inner resolve against the amulet’s magical energy.\n\nOn a successful save:\n\nYou steady yourself, and the chill recedes slightly, allowing you to hold the amulet without further discomfort. The amulet seems to accept your touch, as if acknowledging your intentions.\n\nOn a failed save:\n\nYou recoil at the chill and find your fingers badly injured. You take 2 points of cold damge, and the amulet clatters to the hard floor.\n\nAt this moment, a figure steps into the doorway: Mr. Moss."
