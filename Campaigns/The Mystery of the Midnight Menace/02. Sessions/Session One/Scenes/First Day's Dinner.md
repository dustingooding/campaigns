  description: "Ki.\n\nThe [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/05. Locations/Dining Hall.md|Dining Hall]] of Evercreek Academy is abuzz with the energy only a school full of first-day students can muster. Long, polished tables stretch across the hall, and hundreds of candles float overhead, casting a warm glow over the bustling scene. The students here — including you — are an eclectic mix of bookish academics, budding wizards, aspiring adventurers, and even the occasional noble’s child, all eager to leave their mark. The faint aroma of tonight’s stew lingers in the air, mingling with the ever-present scent of ink and parchment.\n\nAs you gather around a table with your fellow first-year students, you notice clusters of students huddled together, whispering urgently and glancing nervously at the far corners of the room. A phrase reaches your ears again and again, uttered in hushed tones: “The Midnight Menace.” A tall, raven-haired student named Nina leans over, her eyes wide as she whispers, “Have you heard? They’re saying something strange is going on around school… some sort of creature or spirit wandering the halls at night!” She shivers dramatically but then smiles, clearly enjoying the thrill of the rumor.\n\nAnother student chimes in, a serious-looking elf with his arms crossed, “It’s more than just stories. The Library’s missing books, the Alchemy Lab’s had strange potions brewing, and someone even saw Mr. Moss, the janitor, lurking around the storeroom late last night.” He gives a suspicious look as he mentions Mr. Moss, the usually cheerful janitor who’s been at the school for decades.\n\nAt this point, students around you begin to speculate openly:\n\n```\n“Some say it’s a curse!”\n\n“I heard the Midnight Menace is just Mr. Moss trying to scare us!”\n\n“No way, I bet it’s a test — like, for a secret school club.”\n```\n\nAs the chatter continues, you overhear mentions of different locations where the “Midnight Menace” has supposedly appeared: the Library, the Alchemy Lab, and the Basement Storeroom. Some students mention an old legend of an “Amulet of Shadows,” hidden somewhere on the grounds. No one really knows the whole story, but rumors say it grants its wearer the power to become invisible.\n\n> At this point, turn to each of your fellow students and introduce yourselves. What brought you to Evercreek Academy, and what do you make of all this?\n\n> Allow each player to introduce their character, giving them a moment to share a detail or two about what they look like, where they’re from, and how they react to the mystery rumors. \n> When everyone has introduced their characters, continue with the following:\n\n[[Eloise Merriweather]] is a stern, meticulous woman in her 50s who takes her role as Headmaster seriously. With her sharp eyes and even sharper tongue, she keeps a tight rein on the school’s order. Though intimidating, she is not unkind, and she has a genuine concern for students’ welfare beneath her strict exterior. Mrs. Merriweather stands at the front of the dining hall, clearing her throat as she gestures for quiet. The students settle down, curious as she raises her voice to speak.\n\n```\n\"Good evening, everyone. Tonight, we take a moment to honor someone who’s woven into the very fabric of this school. For forty years — yes, four entire decades — [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/03. Non Player Characters/Staff/Janitor Jonathan Moss.md|Janitor Moss]] has been here, quietly watching over our halls, fixing our broken doors, mending our leaky pipes, and, more often than not, picking up after all of you,\" she adds with a wry smile that brings a ripple of laughter through the crowd.\n\n\"But Mr. Moss is more than just the man with the keys. He’s a keeper of this school’s history, a watchful guardian of our grounds, and a friend to any who seek him out. Whether it’s a late-night repair, a hidden mess in the alchemy lab\" — she glances meaningfully at a few students, earning some sheepish grins — \"or simply a kind word when one is needed most, Mr. Moss is there. He’s given more than we could ever ask for, and he’s done it all with a quiet smile and steady patience that inspires us all.\"\n\nShe pauses, her expression softening as she turns to Mr. Moss. \"Mr. Moss, we can’t imagine this place without you. On behalf of the entire school, thank you for your dedication, your hard work, and for all the ways you’ve made our lives better over these forty remarkable years. Here’s to you.\"\n```\n\nThe dining hall erupts into applause as Mr. Moss, blushing deeply, nods with a small, grateful smile.\n\nThe grand clock above the head table chimes, signaling the end of dinner. Most students begin to head off, but the mystery of the Midnight Menace lingers in the back of your minds. You catch each other’s eyes, feeling a thrill of curiosity.\n\nThe night is still young, and it wouldn’t hurt to take a quick look around before heading to bed… after all, first-years or not, the thrill of uncovering a school mystery is too tempting to resist."
