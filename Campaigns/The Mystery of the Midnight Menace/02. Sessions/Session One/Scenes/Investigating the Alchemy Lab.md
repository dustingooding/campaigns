  description: "Sho.\n\nThe [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/05. Locations/Alchemy Lab.md|Alchemy Lab]] sits at the far end of a winding corridor, marked by a heavy oak door reinforced with iron bands. As you push it open, you catch a whiff of bitter herbs and something metallic, like copper or sulfur, that tickles the back of your throat. The room itself is dimly lit, with stone counters lined with glass beakers, alembics, and vials filled with brightly colored liquids, casting reflections on the walls.\n\nWhat would you like to look at first?\n\n> Pause to give players a chance to choose a direction, such as checking counters, shelves, or other parts of the lab.\n\n**For players investigating the overall room or looking for tracks:**\n\nYou scan the lab, taking in the scattered items and faint traces of activity. Near the door, a faint trail of silvery powder leads toward the hallway, as if whoever was here didn’t realize they were leaving a mark. The trace is barely visible in the candlelight, but it’s a solid clue that might lead you to the Midnight Menace.\n\n> Encourage players to follow the trail, make a Perception check, or investigate further.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Powder Trail in The Alchemy Lab.md|Powder Trail in The Alchemy Lab]] \n\n**If the players choose to approach the bubbling cauldron**:\n\nOne of the counters is crowded with equipment around a small cauldron that’s still bubbling gently. Thin wisps of greenish smoke rise from it, filling the air with a faint, minty scent that’s unusual for this type of potion. It looks like whoever was working on this left in a hurry, leaving the setup undisturbed.\n\n> Invite players to inspect the ingredients nearby, make an Investigation or Arcana check, or even taste a sample if they’re bold!\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Ingredients in The Alchemy Lab.md|Ingredients in The Alchemy Lab]] \n\n**If the players choose to investigate the shelves or counters nearby:**\n\nShelves stacked high with books and labeled vials line the walls, casting deep shadows. As you inspect them, you notice several containers have been disturbed recently — one vial is open, spilling a fine layer of silvery powder across the counter.\n\n> Encourage players to make an Investigation or Perception check here, or prompt them to closely examine the powder.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07. Clues/Invisibility Powder in Alchemy Lab.md|Invisibility Powder in Alchemy Lab]] \n\n**If players check the experiment notes or potion book:**\n\nA thick potion book lies open, with several pages dog-eared. The open page details instructions for an Obscuring Mist Potion, but there’s something unusual about it. Scribbled in the margin are words like “time-sensitive” and “double dose?” along with what looks like a small, hastily sketched symbol — a dark spiral circled in black.\n\n> Invite players to make an Intelligence check or Arcana check to interpret the notes.\n\nOn a successful check: [[Campaigns/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/07.
