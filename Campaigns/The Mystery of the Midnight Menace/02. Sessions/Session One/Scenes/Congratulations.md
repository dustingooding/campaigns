  description: "Ketsu.\n\nThe following day, as the sun filters through the tall, arched windows of the grand [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/05. Locations/Dining Hall.md|Dining Hall]], you and your friends find yourselves summoned to the front of the room where [[obsidian_personal/D&D/The Mystery of the Midnight Menace/03. Non Player Characters/Staff/Eloise Merriweather.md|Mrs. Merriweather]] stands, her sharp gaze softened with something close to pride. The dining hall quiets down as students watch, their faces a mix of curiosity and admiration.\n\nMrs. Merriweather clears her throat, her voice carrying with practiced ease. \n\n> “Yesterday, our school faced a shadow we had not anticipated. And yet, when faced with this darkness, some of our own rose above it.”\n\nShe turns her gaze to each of you, nodding with a small, appreciative smile. \n\n> “You showed courage, resilience, and above all, a dedication to one another and to this school. This institution is not just built of stone and mortar but of the strength and character of its students. You have proven yourselves worthy of that legacy.”\n\nShe steps back, pausing, as the hall remains utterly silent, and then raises her voice slightly. \n\n> “It is my great pleasure to announce that, effective immediately, you are all granted a place in the Honors Practicum. For the rest of the semester, you will work closely with our top professors, honing your talents in ways that match your newfound experience and responsibility.”\n\nA small, proud smile crosses her face. \n\n> “Welcome to the Honors class. May you continue to protect and uphold this school’s values.”\n\nThe hall fills with applause, and students around you clap and cheer, some whispering in admiration as you take in the weight of your accomplishment. Mrs. Merriweather nods to you one last time, a rare gleam of approval in her usually strict eyes. The sense of pride and camaraderie settles around you, marking the start of a new, promising chapter at the academy."
