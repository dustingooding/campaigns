  description: "The game takes place at Evercreek Academy, a sprawling, slightly eerie school of both mundane and magical studies. The academy has a long-standing reputation for being a place where students not only learn about history, languages, mathematics, and magic but also grow into powerful adventurers. Recently, students have reported strange incidents happening in the middle of the night: books vanishing from the library, cauldrons bubbling on their own in the alchemy labs, and mysterious notes left in the dorm rooms.\n\nThe players are first-year students who discover a troubling mystery. Rumors are swirling that an “entity” has been spotted lurking around the school grounds at midnight, and certain items seem to go missing every night. The headmaster and faculty dismiss these events as pranks, but the players overhear whispers of a powerful artifact rumored to be hidden somewhere in the school. Could it be related?\n\nThe players must uncover who or what is behind the strange occurrences at Evercreek Academy and discover the true motivation behind these nightly disruptions. Their investigation will lead them to surprising discoveries about the staff and a powerful item hidden on school grounds."
