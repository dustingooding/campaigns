  description: "The runes suggest this amulet was crafted long ago, intended as a tool to hide something — or someone — from detection. However, the faint markings at the edges indicate a seal was recently broken, as if the amulet had been awakened from a long slumber. Whoever did this intended to bring its power into the present."
