  description: "You recognize some of the ingredients scattered around the cauldron — mandrake root, powdered silver, and a vial of “Essence of Nightshade.” Whoever was here was brewing an Obscuring Mist Potion, often used for concealing one’s location. A closer look at the open potion book beside it reveals a few scrawled notes in the margins — they’re smudged, as if the writer was in a rush. The handwriting looks messy, perhaps even panicked."
