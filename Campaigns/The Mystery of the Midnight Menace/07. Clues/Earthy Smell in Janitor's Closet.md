  description: "The hum has a distinct magical quality. You sense that the vibrations align with shadow magic, hinting that this room may be connected to the Midnight Menace sightings. The earthy smell is similar to that in the school’s lower storage rooms, suggesting a hidden connection — perhaps Mr. Moss has been using tunnels beneath the school."
