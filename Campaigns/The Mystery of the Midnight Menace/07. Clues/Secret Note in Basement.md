  description: "You find a folded piece of parchment wedged under the crate. The note mentions a ritual involving “shadow essence” and an “amulet of concealment.” The handwriting looks similar to the scrawled notes in the Alchemy Lab — hurried and almost frantic, as if the writer was racing against time."
