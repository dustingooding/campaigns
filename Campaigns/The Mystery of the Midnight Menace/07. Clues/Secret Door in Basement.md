  description: "With a faint rumbling, the outline in the stone shudders, and a thin seam begins to open. Dust falls from the wall as a hidden door slowly creaks open, revealing a dark passage beyond. The air from inside the passage is colder, and there’s a faint whiff of something metallic, almost like blood."
