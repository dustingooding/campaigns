  description: "This spiral symbol looks vaguely familiar; it might relate to shadow magic, which is rarely taught here at Evercreek. Whoever wrote this likely knew more about the Amulet of Shadows and its effects than a typical student would. Could this be a clue left by someone close to the schoolâ€¦ or someone using it for personal gain?"
