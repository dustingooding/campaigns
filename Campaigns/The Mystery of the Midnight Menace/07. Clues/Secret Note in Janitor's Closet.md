  description: "The note is written hastily, with the words “Amulet of Shadows” circled several times in ink, followed by the cryptic phrase, “Unseen paths must be preserved.” The handwriting is shaky, as if written in a hurry. At the bottom of the note, there’s an unfinished sentence: “Tonight, after the last bell, I will…” but it cuts off abruptly, as if Mr. Moss was interrupted."
