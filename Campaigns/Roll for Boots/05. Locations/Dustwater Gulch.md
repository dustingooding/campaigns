  description: "The town earned its name from the dusty trails that run through it and the small creek that once provided water to early settlers.\n\nDustwater Gulch is best known for silver mining, which brought the first waves of settlers to the area. The mines are still active but are beginning to show signs of depletion, forcing some to turn to ranching or small-scale farming. A handful of saloons and general stores also cater to travelers and locals."
