  description: "The Starlight Saloon sits at the heart of Dustwater Gulch, its weathered sign swaying slightly in the dry evening breeze. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of spilled whiskey, cheap tobacco, and sawdust strewn across the warped floorboards. Lanterns hang from crooked beams, their flickering light casting long, jittery shadows that dance on the peeling walls. A polished mahogany bar stretches across one side of the room, lined with mismatched stools and a bartender who seems more interested in polishing glasses than paying attention to the customers.\n\nThe room hums with quiet activityâ€”a group of miners huddle around a corner table playing cards, their voices low and tense, while a pair of ranch hands lean against the bar, laughing loudly over their drinks. In one corner, a battered piano sits unattended, its keys yellowed and uneven, though occasionally someone stumbles over to hammer out a tune. Above the bar, an impressive rack of antlers dominates the wall, alongside faded posters promising bounties for outlaws long since forgotten. The room itself feels alive with history and tension, a place where strangers eye each other cautiously, waiting to see if the night will bring a fistfight, a business deal, or something far more dangerous."
