  description: "[The Stranger](https://rollforshoes.com/settings/the-stranger)\n\nSomewhere along the dusty western frontier, there's a rough town just struggling to survive. Dustwater Gulch.  The town earned its name from the dusty trails that run through it and the small creek that once provided water to early settlers.\n\nDustwater Gulch has built up from the first settlement in this area, after it drew crowds of folks for business opportunities, frontier adventure, and for some, the promise of a better future. It's best known for silver mining, which brought the first waves of settlers to the area. The mines are still active but are beginning to show signs of depletion, forcing some to turn to ranching or small-scale farming. A handful of general stores cater to travelers and locals. And if course the saloon in the middle of town is busy every night. \n\nSome would say the surrounding area is scenic. Others call the wilderness desolate. From The Hollow Hills and Deadman's Ridge, to The Glass Flats and of course Drywater Creek itself, there's plenty of locations to busy yourself in.\n\nYou are a citizen of Drywater Gulch. What's your name?  You have to make a living, how do you contribute to the town? And what do you do in your spare time?"
