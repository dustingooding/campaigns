  description: "As your consciousness begins to settle, you feel disoriented, like waking from a dream you can’t quite remember. Your mind struggles to reconcile two realities: the one you left behind and the one you’ve suddenly dropped into. For a moment, your vision blurs, and your senses catch up with you one at a time—the weight of unfamiliar clothes on your body, the dry heat of the sun on your skin, the faint scent of dust and leather.\n\nYou realize you’re not you—not completely. Your hands, your face, your very body feels different. Looking down, you see calloused fingers, weathered boots, or the hem of a dress you don’t recognize. It hits you all at once: this isn’t your world, your life.\n\nYour thoughts are your own, but fragments of the person you now inhabit flicker at the edge of your mind—a name, a job, a relationship, a memory not your own. The people around you seem to know you, calling out greetings or giving wary glances, as if everything about this moment is perfectly ordinary to them.\n\nYou’ve done this before—time and space folded, and you were sent. You don’t know exactly why or what needs fixing, but you know there’s a purpose. Somewhere in this place, this time, there’s a thread of history in danger of unraveling.\n\nThe world around you sharpens: the sound of boots on wooden planks, the distant whinny of horses, the creak of a swinging saloon door. This place... it feels raw and wild, steeped in history and danger. Dustwater Gulch, 1876. You’re here for a reason.\n\nBut what reason? What event are you here to change, and how much time do you have to figure it out? One thing is certain: you can’t leave until your work is done. And the clock is already ticking."
