  description: "A stranger strides into the Starlight Saloon, the swinging doors creaking ominously in his wake. He’s a tall, imposing figure, dressed head to toe in black: a long duster caked with the dust of the trail, scuffed leather boots, and a wide-brimmed hat that casts a shadow over his face. What little can be seen of his features—sharp cheekbones, a rough, stubbled jawline, and cold, steel-gray eyes—sends a chill through the room. His hand rests lightly on the butt of a polished revolver holstered at his hip, though an arsenal of weapons hangs from his frame, including a rifle slung over his back and a knife sheathed in his boot.\n\nThe air in the saloon grows heavy as his spurs clink against the wooden floorboards with every deliberate step. He doesn’t glance at anyone as he approaches the bar but carries an aura that demands attention, daring anyone to make a wrong move. His voice, when he finally speaks, is low and gravelly, with just a hint of menace. “Whiskey. Neat.”\n\nAs he lifts his head slightly to down his drink, a long scar running from his temple to the edge of his jaw catches the flickering light. It’s a face that’s seen violence—and caused plenty of it. He doesn’t wait for the bartender’s response before adding, “Somebody should get the sheriff. We have business.” His words hang in the air like a loaded gun, and every patron knows the night is about to take a dangerous turn."
