  description: "February 8th.  The citizens of Dustwater Gulch are enjoying a calm, perfectly normal afternoon beneath the blazing sun. The rhythmic clanging of a hammer rings out from the blacksmith’s forge, where old Grady Two-Fingers is hard at work repairing a miner’s bent pickaxe. Down the street, the general store’s door creaks open and shut as ranchers and townsfolk shuffle in and out, collecting supplies or chatting idly with Mrs. Darla Pettigrew, the store’s sharp-tongued proprietor.\n\nChildren dart between the buildings, chasing each other with sticks and letting out carefree laughter, their shouts mixing with the occasional bray of a mule tied up outside the post office. A pair of ranch hands are wrangling a stubborn steer in the dusty lot near the livery stable, their muttered curses and whistles audible from across the street. Over at the Starlight Saloon, the faint notes of a piano tune drift out through the swinging doors, accompanied by the hum of conversation and the clink of glasses.\n\nIn the town square, Sheriff Amos Roosevelt leans lazily against a wooden post outside his office, sipping from a tin cup and tipping his hat to passersby. The air smells of baking bread, carried over from Mrs. Louisa Finley’s bakery, where the window display gleams with fresh rolls and pies cooling in the afternoon sun. Ervin McDermot's Tonics and Tinctures catches the occasional passerby's attention, but business is slow. A stray dog dozes in the shade of the butcher shop, stirring only when someone tosses it a scrap.\n\nAll around, life hums along with quiet purpose, the townsfolk moving through familiar routines—trading goods, tending animals, and sharing stories in small groups. For now, Dustwater Gulch is peaceful, the kind of ordinary afternoon that holds no hint of the trouble that might be brewing just over the horizon."
