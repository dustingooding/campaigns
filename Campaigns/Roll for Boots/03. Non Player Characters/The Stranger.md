  description: "He’s a tall, imposing figure, dressed head to toe in black: a long duster caked with the dust of the trail, scuffed leather boots, and a wide-brimmed hat that casts a shadow over his face. What little can be seen of his features—sharp cheekbones, a rough, stubbled jawline, and cold, steel-gray eyes—sends a chill through the room. His hand rests lightly on the butt of a polished revolver holstered at his hip, though an arsenal of weapons hangs from his frame, including a rifle slung over his back and a knife sheathed in his boot."
