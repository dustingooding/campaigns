  description: "The barkeeper, Milo \"Moss\" Granger, is a wiry man in his mid-50s with a face as weathered as the wooden bar he tends. His graying hair is swept back, revealing a receding hairline that does nothing to diminish the sharpness in his pale green eyes. A wiry mustache twitches above his lips whenever he smirks, which happens often—usually at the expense of his customers. His hands are calloused, quick, and constantly moving, whether it’s wiping down a glass with a threadbare rag or sliding a drink across the counter with practiced ease.\n\nMilo’s voice is gravelly, the product of years of shouting over saloon brawls and inhaling too much cigar smoke. Despite his lean frame, he carries himself with an air of quiet authority, and more than one patron has thought twice before trying to start trouble in his establishment. He wears a simple white shirt, rolled up at the sleeves, and a dark vest adorned with a single silver pocket watch chain. Rumor has it that he keeps a loaded shotgun under the bar, though no one’s seen him use it—yet.\n\nWhile Milo is happy to share a drink and a quip, he rarely offers more than surface-level conversation, keeping his own past as much of a mystery as the origins of his nickname. If pressed, he’ll only shrug and say, “Moss grows on the quiet stones.” Whatever that means."
