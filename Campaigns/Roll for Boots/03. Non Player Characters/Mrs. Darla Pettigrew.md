  description: "Mrs. Darla Pettigrew is the sharp-eyed, sharp-tongued proprietor of Pettigrew’s General Store, a bustling hub of activity in Dustwater Gulch. Standing just shy of five feet tall, she makes up for her petite stature with a commanding presence. Her salt-and-pepper hair is always pinned into a tight bun, and her wire-rimmed spectacles perch low on her nose, giving her a perpetually scrutinizing gaze that makes customers think twice about trying to haggle.\n\nDarla’s voice is as crisp as a fresh sheet of parchment, capable of cutting through the chatter of the busiest afternoon. She speaks with a brisk, no-nonsense tone, but there’s a warmth beneath it for those who’ve earned her favor—or paid their credit on time. Her dress is always practical, a plain but well-maintained frock with an apron tied around her waist, the pockets stuffed with receipts, pencils, and the occasional peppermint candy.\n\nShe runs her store with the precision of a clockmaker, knowing exactly where every sack of flour, tin of coffee, or bolt of fabric is located, and she doesn’t hesitate to lecture anyone who dares to misplace something. Yet, despite her strict demeanor, she’s fiercely loyal to the town, often extending credit to struggling families or slipping a free biscuit to a hungry child when no one’s looking.\n\nDarla has a sharp wit and a dry sense of humor that can catch people off guard, often muttering quips under her breath about the “foolishness of men” or the latest town gossip. If anyone needs advice—or the latest scandal—she’s the one to ask, though she’ll deliver her answers with a raised brow and a smirk that suggests she knows far more than she’s letting on."
