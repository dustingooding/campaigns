  description: "Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt, an energetic eight-year-old with a freckled face and a head full of unruly red hair, is the spirited son of Sheriff Amos Roosevelt. Though he has the wiry frame and youthful clumsiness of a boy not yet grown into himself, there’s something undeniably magnetic about him—a spark of intelligence and determination far beyond his years. His round spectacles, perched slightly askew on his nose, glint in the sunlight, lending him a precocious air that contrasts with his dirt-scuffed boots and patched-up knickers.\n\nTeddy has a boundless curiosity, forever poking his nose into things he probably shouldn’t. He’s the kind of kid who peppers adults with questions that often have no easy answers, earning him equal parts affection and exasperation from the townsfolk. Despite his small stature, he carries himself with an earnest confidence, speaking with a surprising conviction that sometimes makes grown men stop and take notice.\n\nHe idolizes his father, the sheriff, but not without a touch of stubbornness that hints at a fiercely independent spirit. He’s known to follow Amos around town, a wooden stick tucked into his belt like a revolver, trying his best to mimic his father’s commanding presence. Yet, his heart leans more toward books and stories of adventure than gunplay, and he often slips away to devour whatever reading material he can get his hands on, no matter how dusty or dog-eared.\n\nTeddy’s voice is still high-pitched with youth, but it carries an odd weight when he speaks, as though he’s already pondering the larger questions of the world. While other kids might shy away from danger, Teddy often runs headlong into it—whether chasing a stray dog into the creek or standing up to a bully twice his size. His bravery is unpolished but undeniable, a raw determination that, someday, might shape him into a leader.\n\nFor now, though, Teddy is simply the sheriff’s curious, headstrong son—equal parts a handful and a joy. Those who meet him may not yet see the great man he’ll one day become, but they can’t help but sense that the dusty streets of Dustwater Gulch are merely the start of something much, much bigger."
