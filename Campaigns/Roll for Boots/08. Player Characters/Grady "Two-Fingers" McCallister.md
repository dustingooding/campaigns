  description: "Grady \"Two-Fingers\" McCallister is a grizzled blacksmith with a frame as sturdy as the anvil he works on. His nickname comes from the fact that his left hand has only two fingers remaining, the others lost long ago in a mining accident—or so he claims. He wears the injury like a badge of honor, waving his mangled hand with a crooked grin whenever someone asks for the story.\n\nHis face is lined with years of hard work, framed by a thick, gray beard streaked with soot. Bushy eyebrows sit low over piercing blue eyes that gleam with a mixture of wisdom and mischief. A blackened leather apron covers his sweat-stained shirt, and his muscular arms, covered in faded tattoos of anchors and flames, flex with every swing of his hammer.\n\nGrady speaks in a deep, gravelly voice, his words punctuated by a raspy chuckle that can be heard over the din of his forge. Though he’s a man of few words, he’s quick with a sharp-witted comeback or a wry observation about town life. The forge is his domain, a cluttered yet efficient workshop filled with tools, half-finished projects, and the smell of iron and ash.\n\nDespite his rough exterior, Grady has a soft spot for the kids in town, often fashioning little trinkets or toys out of scrap metal when business is slow. He’s a cornerstone of Dustwater Gulch, respected by the townsfolk for his skill and dependability—and feared by anyone foolish enough to challenge him to an arm-wrestling match."
