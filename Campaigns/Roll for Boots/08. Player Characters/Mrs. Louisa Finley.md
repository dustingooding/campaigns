  description: "Mrs. Louisa Finley is the warm and welcoming heart of Dustwater Gulch, known far and wide for the mouthwatering aromas that drift from her bakery at all hours. She’s a plump woman in her late 40s, with rosy cheeks, twinkling brown eyes, and a perpetual dusting of flour on her apron. Her curly auburn hair, streaked with silver, is always tied back with a colorful kerchief, though a few rebellious strands inevitably escape during her busy mornings at the oven.\n\nLouisa’s hands are strong and skilled, kneading dough or frosting cakes with the same care she gives to her customers. Her bakery is a haven of comfort, offering fresh-baked bread, warm pies, and sweet rolls that often sell out before noon. The bell above her bakery door jingles constantly, and she greets each visitor with a cheerful, “Come on in, sugar! What can I get for ya?”\n\nHer voice is rich and melodious, with a soothing tone that has settled many disputes over coffee and biscuits at one of her small wooden tables. Despite her kind demeanor, Louisa doesn’t tolerate nonsense—she’s quick to shoo out loafers or scold children for sticking their fingers in the jam.\n\nRumor has it she has a knack for listening and gives surprisingly sage advice when someone confides in her over a slice of apple pie. Many suspect she knows more about the town’s secrets than even the sheriff, but she guards them fiercely, only sharing what’s necessary to keep the peace.\n\nShe’s a widow, her husband having passed several years back in a mining accident, but she carries on with a quiet strength that inspires those around her. The townsfolk consider her bakery more than just a business—it’s a cornerstone of Dustwater Gulch and a reminder that even in a harsh frontier town, there’s always a place for warmth and kindness."
