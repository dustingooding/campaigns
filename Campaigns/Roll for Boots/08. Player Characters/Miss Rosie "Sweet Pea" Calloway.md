  description: "Miss Rosie “Sweet Pea” Calloway is the Starlight Saloon’s most charming and sought-after presence, a vivacious woman with a knack for making anyone feel like the center of her world. In her early 30s, Rosie carries herself with a confidence that turns heads and an easy smile that hides just enough mischief to keep folks intrigued. She’s petite but curvaceous, with auburn curls that cascade over her shoulders, sparkling green eyes that seem to see straight through a person, and a voice as sweet and smooth as honey.\n\nRosie earned her nickname, “Sweet Pea,” not just for her soft, floral perfume but also for her habit of addressing everyone—be it a shy ranch hand or a grizzled miner—with affectionate terms like “darlin’” and “sugar.” Her wardrobe is always just a touch more colorful than modest, with dresses of vibrant satin and lace that she adjusts throughout the night to keep just the right amount of attention.\n\nWhile her primary profession is clear, Rosie’s true specialty is conversation. She has a gift for drawing out secrets with a well-timed laugh or a conspiratorial whisper, and her ability to weave through delicate topics makes her the unofficial information broker of Dustwater Gulch. Everyone talks to Rosie—whether over a drink, a dance, or a private moment—and she remembers every word, filing it all away for later.\n\nThough she’s often the first to hear the town’s juiciest gossip, Rosie isn’t malicious with her knowledge. She knows how to keep a secret when it matters, often using her insights to nudge folks in the right direction or warn them of brewing trouble. Her quick wit and genuine affection for the townsfolk make her a beloved figure in the saloon, even among those who might otherwise look down on her line of work.\n\nBehind the charm, Rosie has a keen sense of survival and a heart of gold. She’s been known to lend an ear—or even a coin—to someone down on their luck, and her laughter and warmth often brighten even the darkest corners of the saloon. For Rosie, life in Dustwater Gulch is about more than just getting by—it’s about living, loving, and making sure she’s always one step ahead of the drama swirling around her."
