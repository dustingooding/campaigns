  description: "Ervin McDermot, the jovial snake oil salesman from Kansas City, is a whirlwind of charisma and energy wrapped in a loud plaid suit that’s seen better days. His wide-brimmed hat, adorned with a faded feather, bobs as he gestures grandly to the small crowd he gathers wherever he sets up his portable wagon stand. Ervin has a booming voice, thick with the Midwest twang of his Kansas City roots, and an uncanny ability to make even the most skeptical listener lean in just a little closer.\n\nTall and wiry, Ervin is perpetually in motion, pacing, gesticulating, and sweeping his arms as he spins tales of miraculous cures and boundless health. His handlebar mustache is waxed to perfection, curling upward in a way that seems to emphasize the twinkle in his sharp blue eyes. Despite the dust of travel on his boots and the sunburn reddening his cheeks, Ervin radiates an air of confidence that makes his outrageous claims almost believable.\n\nHis wagon is a colorful spectacle, painted with bold lettering advertising “Dr. McDermot’s Miracle Elixirs” alongside crude illustrations of glowing, muscular figures. Shelves inside display dozens of bottles filled with mysterious, amber-colored liquids that Ervin insists can cure everything from rheumatism to heartbreak. Each bottle comes with a long-winded pitch, sprinkled with folksy humor and exaggerated testimonials from “grateful” customers he met along the way.\n\nThough many in Dustwater Gulch are skeptical of his wares, it’s hard to stay mad at Ervin. His cheerful demeanor is infectious, and he’s quick with a clever quip or a humorous anecdote to defuse tension. He’s even been known to buy rounds at the saloon, declaring, “Good health starts with good spirits, my friends!”\n\nBeneath the bluster, Ervin is sharper than he lets on, reading people with uncanny precision and adjusting his pitch to suit his audience. Some suspect he’s hiding more than just the dubious origins of his elixirs, but he laughs off any accusations with a hearty, “Now why would I lie to fine folks like you?”\n\nFor now, Ervin McDermot is the talk of Dustwater Gulch, his antics providing entertainment, skepticism, and just a little hope to a town always on the lookout for its next miracle."
